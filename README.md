A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. 

The smallest perfect number is 6: its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 

Write a program which will check if the given input is a perfect number or not. 

For Example: 

Input: 6 

Output: true 

Input: 20 

Output: false
